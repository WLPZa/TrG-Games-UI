Here you can find the official TrG UI for TrG Games.
This is a UI designed for simple tasks that are easy to understand but also offer a wide variety of features.
This UI is constantly getting updated so we can add new features but also implement the required bug fixed.
It comes with a resource pack but also a behaviour back, they are both needed to make the UI work, if only one is on the UI will not work as intended and might break something. 
We take no responsibility for that as it would be as a result of your own actions.
This pack was designed to only work for the TrG Games realm but it can also work for personal worlds & any other bedrock realm.
If you are going to use this pack please make sure to give credit to the original author.
